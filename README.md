# Design-and-Verification-of-a-Simplified-Predicated-RISC-Processor-using-Verilog
This project implements a 32-bit simplified predicated RISC processor in Verilog, featuring a complete datapath and control unit design. The processor supports R-Type, I-Type, and J-Type instructions with conditional (predicated) execution based on a general-purpose predicate register, as specified in the ISA.
